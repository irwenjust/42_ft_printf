# 42_ft_printf

Truly do not recommend finishing the bonus part if you think it could be fastly to solve. If you have enough time then it doesn't matter.  

This project grade: 117/100.

One mistake still exists: negative number for * (arguments is less than 0).  
One mistake message from francinette but cannot find the reason(probably is compiler problem): when check '#' sign in %xX, francinette cannot catch the '0x'. But seems it should be.  

Maybe will update more but not soon.
